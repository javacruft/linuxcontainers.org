      <h1>Infrastructure for container projects.</h1>
      <p>linuxcontainers.org is the umbrella project behind LXC,
        LXD and LXCFS.</p>

      <p>The goal is to offer a distro and vendor neutral environment
        for the development of Linux container technologies.</p>

      <p>Our main focus is system containers. That is, containers which
        offer an environment as close as possible as the one you'd get from a
        VM but without the overhead that comes with running a separate
        kernel and simulating all the hardware.</p>

      <h3>LXC</h3>
      <p>LXC is the well known set of tools, templates,
        library and language bindings. It's pretty low
        level, very flexible and covers just about every
        containment feature supported by the upstream
        kernel.</p>
      <p>LXC is production ready with LTS releases coming with 5 years
         of security and bugfix updates.</p>

      <h3>LXD</h3>
      <p>LXD is the new LXC experience. It offers a
        completely fresh and intuitive user experience
        with a single command line tool to manage your
        containers. Containers can be managed over the
        network in a transparent way through a REST API.
        It also works with large scale deployments by
        integrating with cloud platforms like OpenNebula.</p>

      <h3>LXCFS</h3>
      <p>Userspace (FUSE) filesystem offering two main things:
        <ul>
          <li>Overlay files for cpuinfo, meminfo, stat and uptime.</li>
          <li>A cgroupfs compatible tree allowing unprivileged writes.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>It's designed to workaround the shortcomings of procfs, sysfs
        and cgroupfs by exporting files which match what a system
        container user would expect.</p>

      <h3>CGManager</h3>
      <p>CGManager is our cgroup manager daemon. It's
        designed to allow nested unprivileged containers
        to still be able to create and manage their
        cgroups through a DBus API.</p>

      <p>CGManager was used by default with LXC in
        Ubuntu since April 2014 and then by other
        distributions as they started needing working
        unprivileged containers.</p>

      <p>It has now been deprecated in favor of the CGroup namespace
        in recent Linux kernels. On older kernels, LXCFS still offers
        a cgroupfs emulation that can be used instead of cgmanager
        and is more widely compatible with existing userspace.</p>
